### VIMRC-PHP

Vim settings for php environments (also frameworks)

To install just clone this repo from your .vim folder and change the vimrc file to:
`source ~/.vim/vimrc-php/vimrc`

There is also an install.sh file where all the extra libraries needed to complete the settings are listed, and their commands to do it.

The install.sh should set up everything, but I suggest you to execute each command separatelly on your own.

This vimrc requires vim-plug, so better to install all the extras in install.sh before launching vim.

I'm used to start vim from the project root directory.


### BEFORE GOING ON WITH THE install.sh:

Download eclipse and place it at the $HOME dir: https://eclipse.org/downloads/

Download eclim, use eclim installer, download and place it at the $HOME dir: http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclim/files/eclim/

Donwload a patched font of your like for coding, this is mine: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/patched-fonts/SourceCodePro/Medium/complete/Sauce%20Code%20Pro%20Medium%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete%20Mono.ttf and place it at the $HOME dir
